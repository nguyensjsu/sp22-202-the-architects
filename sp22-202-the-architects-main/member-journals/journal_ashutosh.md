## Week 1

- ### What I did: 
    - Setup dev environment: install Greenfoot.
    - Get familiar with Greenfoot APIs.

- ### What I plan to do next: 
    - Get aqcuainted with the objective task: Build UNO game
    - Identify the objects and various interactions required
    - Design UML class diagrams.

- ### Blockers: 
    - N/A

- ### XP Value:
    - ### Simplicity 
        - Facilitated the team to begin on a simple note and not get lost in the intricacies of the project. 
        - There was significant confusion in the team in regards to how should one approach the task. Dealt with the confusion by suggesting team to start small. 
        - Instead of diving deep into project designing, suggested to focus on getting familiar with Greenfoot first by building small starter projects.


## Week 2

- ### What I did: 
    - Gained a high level understanding of the task: Build UNO game.
    - Identified the objects and the relationships.
    - Designed the class diagram of Card component of the game.
    - Laid down the base interfaces, constants and enums for the Card component.

- ### What I plan to do next: 
    - Design UML class diagrams.
    - Map State pattern with the game controller logic.

- ### Blockers: 
    - N/A

- ### XP Value:
    - ### Simplicity 
        - After getting familiar with the dev environment and tools, focused on decoding the high-level structure of the project. 
        - Key objective was to brainstorm and come up with individual classes and their relationships. 
        - A couple developers would be working on designing UML class diagrams, while others would be designing images to be used for UI, starting with the various types of cards.


## Week 3

- ### What I did: 
    - Designed the class diagram of the Player component of the game.
    - Laid down the base interfaces, constants and enums for the Player component.
    - Updated class structure of players to implement a base class for implementing the common features of both types of players.
    - Updated the class diagram of players to include the new base Player class in the astah file.

- ### What I plan to do next: 
    - Work on the concrete implementation for Human player and a Computer player.
    - Define the common and varying behaviors of both types of players.
    - Define the logic of Computer player.

- ### Blockers: 
    - Dependency on CardDeck class for Player interface.
    - CardDeck is to be created by a fellow developer and hasn't been implemented yet.
    - Handled it by defining a skeleton interface for CardDeck.

- ### XP Value:
    - ### Simplicity 
        - Focused on keeping the interface definitions for Player components as simple as possible.
        - Discussed, explored the designs & definitions of team members' components to ensure they are simple and in accordance with SOLID design principles.


## Week 4

- ### What I did: 
    - Apply design pattern thinking in the current Players implementation.
    - Identify the scope of strategy pattern in Players implementation.
    - Update the class diagram of Players to implement Strategy pattern.
    - Implement strategy pattern in the Players implementation.
    - Collaborated with the team to integrate all the individual components.

- ### What I plan to do next: 
    - Create a Constants class to include all the constant values used.
    - Refactor the codebase to use the constants defined in the Constants class.

- ### Blockers: 
    - Waiting on minor bugfixes before starting the refactoring.

- ### XP Value:
    - ### Simplicity 
        - Focused on improving and further simplifying the implementation of the Players implementation.
        - Collaborate with the team on integrating all the individual components of the game with a focus on minimizing the scope of modifications done as needed.
        - Aided the team members in the class design for their respective components.
