## Team Journal

### Week 1
- Paramjot Singh
   - What I did: Broke down Uno into objects
   - What I plan to do today: Setup Greenfoot, Plan Design Patterns
   - Blockers: N/A
   - XP Value: Communication. We did struggle with communication earlier in the week, but by using Google Meetings and scheduling meetings in advance we were able to get more responsible with communication. 
    
- Waqas Kureshy
   - What I did: Explored Game development with Greenfoot
   - What I plan to do today: Work on Game Interface, Figure out Design Patterns applicable to the game.
   - Blockers: N/A


- Devansh Modi
   - What I did: Setup local environment for Greenfoot, Swing, and game creation. Wrote boilerplate code.
   - What I plan to do next: Plan for design patterns needed for the UNO game.
   - Blockers: N/A

- Ashutosh Ojha
   - What I did: 
      - Setup dev environment: install Greenfoot.
      - Get familiar with Greenfoot APIs.
   - What I plan to do next: 
      - Get aqcuainted with the objective task: Build UNO game
      - Identify the objects and various interactions required
      - Design UML class diagrams.
   - Blockers: 
      - N/A
   - XP Value:
      - Simplicity 
         - Facilitated the team to begin on a simple note and not get lost in the intricacies of the project. 
         - There was significant confusion in the team in regards to how should one approach the task. Dealt with the confusion by suggesting team to start small. 
         - Instead of diving deep into project designing, suggested to focus on getting familiar with Greenfoot first by building small starter projects.

- Hanyu Hu
   - What I did: 
     - Setup environment for Greenfoot.
     - Getting familiar with Greenfoor development, and try out with some minor projects.
     - Checked the tutorial videos.
   - What I plan to do next: 
     - Brainstorm with for the design patter that could best apply to UNO game
     - Team meeting to finalize the UNO develop circle
     - Start working on the structure of the game.
   - Blockers: N/A
      
### Week 2
- Paramjot Singh
   - What I did: Setup Greenfoot, Plan Design Patterns
   - What I plan to do today: Write code for the Number Cards and larger Card interfaces
   - Blockers: N/A
   - XP Value: Communication. A combination of IRL meeting and scheduled meetings on Google Meetings ensured we performed well in this value.

- Ashutosh Ojha
   - What I did: 
      - Gained a high level understanding of the task: Build UNO game.
      - Identified the objects and the relationships.
   - What I plan to do next: 
      - Design UML class diagrams.
      - Map State pattern with the game controller logic.
   - Blockers: 
      - N/A
   - XP Value:
      - Simplicity 
         - After getting familiar with the dev environment and tools, focused on decoding the high-level structure of the project. 
         - Key objective was to brainstorm and come up with individual classes and their relationships. 
         - A couple developers would be working on designing UML class diagrams, while others would be designing images to be used for UI, starting with the various types of cards.

- Hanyu HU
   - What I did: 
      - Get familiar with UNO rules and practice with team
      - BrainStorm the design patterns gonna apply with teams (State Machine Pattern / Observer patter)
   - What I plan to do next: 
      - After the CRC cards are created, start coding the initial code an fram works
   - Blockers: 
      - N/A
   - XP Value:
      - Communication, weekly scrum meeting help me to communicate with team regards to the Design or blokers
      - Feedback, given feedback for the current state we are, and for the design pattern that planning to use
